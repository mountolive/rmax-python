# rmax-python
Implementation of RL algorithm Rmax in Python.

Strongly based (if not plainly copied) from https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap (the real deal)

It is supposed to be based on Burlap's Tabular Rmax model, 
with support for any number of players (instead of a MDP's context). 

Yet, very naive tentative with educational purposes.
